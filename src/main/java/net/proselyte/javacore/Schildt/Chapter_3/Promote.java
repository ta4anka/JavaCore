/*
double result = (f * b) + (i / c) - (d * s);

In the first subexpression, f * b, b is promoted to a float and the result of the subexpression
is float. Next, in the subexpression i/c, c is promoted to int, and the result is of type int.
Then, in d * s, the value of s is promoted to double, and the type of the subexpression is
double. Finally, these three intermediate values, float, int, and double, are considered. The
outcome of float plus an int is a float. Then the resultant float minus the last double is
promoted to double, which is the type for the final result of the expression.
